```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

```sh
pip install -U pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Before running the assistant, set up the required environment variables:

```sh
LIVEKIT_URL=...
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=...
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=...

OPENAI_API_KEY=...
```

Make sure to replace `...` with the actual values for each variable.
